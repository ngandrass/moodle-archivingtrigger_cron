Cron-based automated archiving trigger plugin for the [Moodle archiving subsystem](https://github.com/ngandrass/moodle-local_archiving/).

You can find more information about the archiving subsystem in the [official documentation](https://archiving.gandrass.de/).


# WARNING: DO NOT USE THIS PLUGIN YET!

This plugin is currently under active development. Please do **not use this plugin in production environments** yet!

Once a stable version is released, this warning will be removed.


# Installation

Archiving triggers (`archivingtrigger`) are sub-plugins of the archiving subsystem core (`local_archiving`) and
therefore require the core plugin to be installed. They then must be placed inside your Moodle directory under
`local/archiving/driver/trigger`.

You can find detailed installation instructions within the [official documentation](https://archiving.gandrass.de/).
If you have problems installing this plugin or have further questions, please feel free to open an issue within the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/ngandrass/moodle-local_archiving/issues).
